            <p class="card-text mb-auto">Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the
              Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices
              such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as
              the Open Handset Alliance and commercially sponsored by Google. It was unveiled in November
              2007, with the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008..</p>

            <p class="mb-auto">iOS (formerly iPhone OS) is a mobile operating system created and developed by
              Apple Inc. exclusively for its hardware. It is the operating system that powers many of the
              company's mobile devices, including the iPhone and iPod Touch; it also powered the iPad until
              the introduction of iPadOS, a derivative of iOS, in 2019. It is the world's second-most widely
              installed mobile operating system, after Android. It is the basis for three other operating
              systems made by Apple: iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS..</p>
