        <p class="lead">The MacBook family was initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines
          which preceded them, now making use of a unibody aluminum construction first introduced with the MacBook Air.
          This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself
          was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard
          brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body..</p>
